## About

Nybygget in the village of Skir is owned by us, Åsa and Sven-Göran Erdtman. The farm includes a two-family house where we live on the ground floor while the upper floor is rented out. Additional rental properties house 18 residents in total.

**Garden produce:** carrots, onions, potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and squash. Blueberries and raspberries are available for self-picking.

**Animals on the farm:** dog, cat, rabbits, and chickens (eggs are served at breakfast).

**In the surrounding area** there are beautiful walking paths, and about 500–600 metres from the farm lie our small lakes, featuring the owners' future residence, flower plantations, waterfalls, wood sculptures, black swans, and seasonal waterfowl. A small chapel at the lakes offers a place for quiet reflection. A wind shelter is available by arrangement. A treehouse sits nine metres up in a pine tree (accessible in good weather and light winds). Barnsjön lake for swimming is three kilometres away.
